# Entropy stable no-slip wall boundary conditions implementation of the Eulerian model

Nonlinear entropy stability analysis is used to derive entropy stable no-slip wall boundary conditions for the Eulerian model proposed by Svärd (Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 2018). and its spatial discretization based on entropy stable collocated discontinuous Galerkin operators with the summation-by-parts property for unstructured grids. A set of viscous test cases of increasing complexity are simulated using both the Eulerian and the classic compressible Navier--Stokes models. The numerical results obtained with the two models are compared, and differences and similarities are then highlighted.
